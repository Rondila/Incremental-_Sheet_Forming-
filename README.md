#Incremental-_Sheet_Forming-
This project contains Python code to generate a toolpath for V-shaped incremental sheet forming (ISF). The toolpath is discretized into steps and allows visualizing the path in a 2D plot while exporting the coordinates for use in external applications.

Features
Generates a toolpath for forming a V-shape with configurable parameters:
Start and end points (A, B, and O).
Depth increments per loop.
Number of steps for discretization.
Outputs the toolpath coordinates in CSV or Excel format.
Computes the total path length of the tool.
Animates the toolpath using matplotlib for visualization.
Requirements
The project requires Python 3.6 or later with the following libraries installed:

numpy: For mathematical calculations.
matplotlib: For visualization and animation.
pandas: For exporting coordinates to files.
openpyxl: Required if exporting to Excel (.xlsx).
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copier le code
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas openpyxl
Code Overview
Input Parameters
Start and end points:
A = (-30, 0) (starting point on the left).
O = (0, 0) (center point).
B = (30, 0) (ending point on the right).
Depth settings:
target_depth = 10 (final depth to reach).
depth_increment = 0.5 (incremental depth per loop).
Discretization:
num_steps = 10 (number of steps between each segment of the path).
Output
Coordinates:
Coordinates of the toolpath are printed in the console.
The toolpath is saved to a CSV (toolpath_coordinates.csv) or Excel file (toolpath_coordinates.xlsx).
Visualization:
A 2D plot of the toolpath is displayed.
A comet-style animation shows the movement of the tool.
Example Output
Coordinates:
plaintext
Copier le code
Step 1: X = -30.00, Z = 0.00
Step 2: X = -27.00, Z = -0.50
...
Step 100: X = 30.00, Z = -10.00
Visualization:
A plot of the toolpath, showing the movement of the tool as it creates the V-shape.

How to Run
Clone this repository:
bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toolpath-generator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copier le code
cd toolpath-generator
Run the script:
bash
Copier le code
python toolpath_generator.py
Exporting Coordinates
The toolpath coordinates are saved in the current directory in both .csv and .xlsx formats. You can find them as:

toolpath_coordinates.csv
toolpath_coordinates.xlsx
Computing Total Path Length
The script calculates the total path length using the Euclidean distance between consecutive points. The result is printed in the console.
